### User Story 1: Set Up FastAPI Webhook
**As a** developer, **I want to** set up a FastAPI webhook **so that** I can receive notifications from Spacelift.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A FastAPI application is created.
- An endpoint `/webhook` is defined to receive POST requests.
- The endpoint processes the incoming payload and logs the data.

### User Story 2: Process Notification Payload
**As a** developer, **I want to** process the notification payload **so that** I can extract relevant information for further processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The payload received by the webhook is parsed.
- Relevant information (e.g., stack ID, status) is extracted from the payload.
- The processed data is logged for verification.

### User Story 3: Set Up Temporal Server
**As a** developer, **I want to** set up a Temporal server **so that** I can run workflows to manage stack execution logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A Temporal server is running locally using Docker.
- The server is accessible and ready to accept workflow definitions.

### User Story 4: Define Temporal Workflow
**As a** developer, **I want to** define a Temporal workflow **so that** I can manage the execution logic for Spacelift stacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A Temporal workflow is defined to handle stack execution.
- The workflow can be triggered with a payload containing stack information.
- The workflow logic is implemented to manage stack execution.

### User Story 5: Integrate FastAPI with Temporal
**As a** developer, **I want to** integrate the FastAPI webhook with Temporal **so that** I can trigger workflows based on Spacelift notifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The FastAPI webhook sends the processed payload to the Temporal workflow.
- The Temporal workflow is triggered successfully with the payload.
- The integration is tested and verified.

### User Story 6: Configure Spacelift Labels
**As a** developer, **I want to** configure labels in Spacelift **so that** I can trigger the FastAPI webhook based on stack changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- Labels are created in Spacelift to trigger the webhook.
- The webhook URL is configured in the Spacelift label settings.
- The labels are tested to ensure they trigger the webhook correctly.

### User Story 7: Test End-to-End Flow
**As a** developer, **I want to** test the end-to-end flow **so that** I can ensure the entire system works as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- A test Spacelift stack change triggers the webhook.
- The webhook processes the payload and triggers the Temporal workflow.
- The Temporal workflow manages the stack execution successfully.
- The entire flow is verified and documented.

### User Story 8: Deploy FastAPI and Temporal
**As a** developer, **I want to** deploy the FastAPI application and Temporal workflows **so that** they are available in a production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The FastAPI application is deployed to a cloud provider or container orchestration platform.
- The Temporal server and workflows are deployed and accessible.
- The deployment is tested and verified.

These user stories should help break down the problem into manageable tasks that can be tackled one at a time.
