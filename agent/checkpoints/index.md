# Checkpoint 8: Temporal Workflow Dummy Implementation

## Instructions Given
- Create a dummy Temporal workflow for testing and demonstration
- Implement a new workflow endpoint in the webhook application
- Enhance Temporal worker configuration
- Update project documentation

## New Information Obtained
- Demonstrated Temporal workflow execution process
- Created a flexible workflow simulation mechanism
- Added endpoint for triggering dummy workflows
- Expanded project documentation to reflect new features

## Changes Made
1. Created new Temporal workflow:
   - Implemented `DummySpaceLiftWorkflow` in `src/spacelift/workflow/dummy_workflow.py`
   - Added workflow simulation with logging stages
   - Included basic error handling

2. Updated Temporal worker configuration:
   - Modified `src/spacelift/temporal_worker.py`
   - Added `DummySpaceLiftWorkflow` to worker's workflow list

3. Enhanced webhook application:
   - Updated `src/spacelift/webhook/app.py`
   - Added `/dummy-workflow` endpoint
   - Implemented workflow triggering mechanism
   - Added logging and error handling for dummy workflow

4. Updated project documentation:
   - Modified `README.md` to include dummy workflow details
   - Added usage instructions
   - Highlighted workflow capabilities

## Technical Details
- Workflow simulates processing stages
- Accepts arbitrary JSON payload
- Returns a dummy result with received payload
- Provides a testable interface for Temporal workflow execution

## Next Steps
- Expand dummy workflow with more complex simulation
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Consider adding configuration options for workflow simulation
- Develop unit tests for the dummy workflow
- Integrate more advanced payload validation
