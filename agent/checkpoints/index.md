# Checkpoint 5: Phase 3 - Local Temporal Server Setup

## Instructions Given
- Set up a local Temporal server using Docker
- Ensure the server is ready to accept workflow definitions

## New Information Obtained
- PostgreSQL needs to be used as the persistence layer for Temporal
- The auto-setup image is required for proper database initialization

## Changes Made
1. Created `docker-compose.yml` with:
   - PostgreSQL service for persistence
   - Temporal server using auto-setup image
   - Temporal UI for workflow monitoring
2. Added health checks to ensure proper service startup order
3. Configured PostgreSQL to use port 5433 to avoid conflicts
4. Updated 'agent/implementation/phase3.md' to mark completed tasks

## Next Steps
- Begin implementing Temporal workflow definitions
- Create worker to execute workflows
- Integrate webhook with Temporal workflows

# Checkpoint 4: Completion of Phase 2 - Enhanced Webhook Payload Processing

## Instructions Given
- Update the webhook to properly parse the input payload from the sample JSON file
- Ensure the webhook returns a structured response with relevant information
- Test the webhook endpoint using FastAPI Swagger docs

## New Information Obtained
- The webhook successfully processes the payload from 'notification-policy.example.global-dev-delhi-airflow02-env-var.json'
- The response from the webhook looks good and meets the current requirements

## Changes Made
1. Updated 'src/spacelift/webhook/app.py':
   - Added a new `WebhookPayload` model to match the structure of the incoming JSON payload
   - Modified the `/webhook` endpoint to accept a `WebhookPayload` instead of a `Request` object
   - Enhanced the payload processing and response structure
2. Updated 'agent/implementation/phase2.md' to reflect the completion of all tasks, including testing

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of Phase 3: Set Up Temporal Server
- Consider adding more detailed validation for the incoming payload in future iterations
- Plan for integration with Temporal workflow in upcoming phases

# Checkpoint 3: Completion of Phase 2 - Enhanced Payload Processing

## Instructions Given
- Enhance payload processing in the FastAPI webhook
- Update documentation to reflect the completion of Phase 2

## New Information Obtained
- All tasks in Phase 2 have been completed
- Additional improvements were made to the payload processing

## Changes Made
1. Updated 'src/spacelift/webhook/app.py':
   - Enhanced the SpaceliftPayload model with additional fields (branch, commit_sha, timestamp, additional_info)
   - Created a separate parse_payload function for better organization and reusability
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Included processed data in the webhook response for easier debugging and verification
2. Updated 'agent/implementation/phase2.md' to mark all tasks as completed and added notes on improvements and next steps
3. Improved payload parsing, information extraction, and logging in the webhook endpoint

## Next Steps
- Implement Temporal workflow triggering (to be done in later phases)
- Add unit tests for the webhook and payload processing
- Consider adding more detailed validation for the incoming payload
- Begin implementation of Phase 3: Set Up Temporal Server

# Checkpoint 2: Completion of Phase 1 - FastAPI Webhook Setup

## Instructions Given
- Complete the remaining task in Phase 1: Process the incoming payload and log the data
- Update documentation to reflect the completion of Phase 1

## New Information Obtained
- All tasks in Phase 1 have been completed
- The FastAPI webhook now processes and logs detailed payload information

## Changes Made
1. Updated 'src/spacelift/webhook/app.py':
   - Implemented SpaceliftPayload model for structured payload processing
   - Added error handling for payload processing
   - Improved logging of processed payload data
2. Updated 'agent/implementation/phase1.md' to mark all tasks as completed
3. Updated README.md to reflect the current status of the webhook implementation

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of Phase 2: Process Notification Payload
- Set up Temporal server (Phase 3)
- Define Temporal workflow (Phase 4)

# Checkpoint 1: Initial Setup and FastAPI Webhook Implementation

## Instructions Given
- Set up project structure for new features
- Implement FastAPI webhook to receive POST requests
- Review and update documentation for Phase 1

## New Information Obtained
- Project now includes webhook and workflow management features
- FastAPI and Temporal will be used for implementation
- Two out of three tasks in Phase 1 have been completed

## Changes Made
1. Updated `pyproject.toml` with new dependencies (FastAPI, uvicorn, and temporalio)
2. Created new directories: `src/spacelift/webhook` and `src/spacelift/workflow`
3. Updated `README.md` to reflect new features and project structure
4. Created `src/spacelift/webhook/app.py` with initial FastAPI application setup
   - Implemented `/webhook` endpoint to receive POST requests
   - Added basic payload logging
5. Updated 'agent/implementation/phase1.md' to mark completed tasks

## Next Steps
- Complete the remaining task in Phase 1: Process the incoming payload and log the data
- Implement payload processing (Phase 2)
- Set up Temporal server (Phase 3)
- Define Temporal workflow (Phase 4)
