## Historical Checkpoints

# Checkpoint 9: Stack Dependency Management Implementation

## Status
- Date: 2024-01-14
- Status: Complete
- Priority: High

## Instructions
- Implement automated stack dependency management
- Use Temporal for workflow orchestration
- Handle webhook notifications for stack completion
- Trigger dependent stack runs automatically

## Analysis
- Decided to use stack labels for dependency declaration
- Chose Temporal for reliable workflow execution
- Designed parent/child workflow architecture
- Implemented retry policies for resilience

## Implementation
1. Stack Dependency System
   - Created label format `dependsOn:stack-id`
   - Implemented dependency discovery via Spacelift API
   - Added filtering logic for dependent stacks

2. Temporal Workflows
   - Implemented StackDependencyChainWorkflow
   - Created StackExecutionWorkflow for individual runs
   - Added retry policies and error handling
   - Implemented activity definitions

3. Webhook Integration
   - Enhanced webhook to handle stack completion events
   - Added workflow triggering logic
   - Implemented error handling and logging
   - Added unique workflow ID generation

4. Documentation
   - Updated README.md with dependency features
   - Created TEMPORAL.md for workflow details
   - Updated architecture and design docs
   - Added workflow standards

## Technical Details
- Files modified:
  - src/app/app.py: Added webhook handling
  - src/temporal/workflows/stack_dependency_chain.py: Added workflows
  - src/temporal/activities/: Added activity implementations
  - Documentation files in agent/design/
- Tools used:
  - Temporal for workflow orchestration
  - FastAPI for webhook handling
  - Spacelift API for stack operations
  - Docker for deployment

## Verification
- Tested webhook payload handling
- Verified dependency discovery logic
- Confirmed workflow chain execution
- Validated stack run triggering
- Checked error handling and retries

## Next Steps
- Implement conditional dependencies
- Add dependency priority levels
- Create dependency visualization tools
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Implement maintenance windows
- Add stack-specific retry policies

# Checkpoint 8: Temporal Workflow Dummy Implementation

## Instructions Given
- Create a dummy Temporal workflow for testing and demonstration
- Implement a new workflow endpoint in the webhook application
- Enhance Temporal worker configuration
- Update project documentation

## New Information Obtained
- Demonstrated Temporal workflow execution process
- Created a flexible workflow simulation mechanism
- Added endpoint for triggering dummy workflows
- Expanded project documentation to reflect new features

## Changes Made
1. Created new Temporal workflow:
   - Implemented `DummySpaceLiftWorkflow` in `src/spacelift/workflow/dummy_workflow.py`
   - Added workflow simulation with logging stages
   - Included basic error handling

2. Updated Temporal worker configuration:
   - Modified `src/spacelift/temporal_worker.py`
   - Added `DummySpaceLiftWorkflow` to worker's workflow list

3. Enhanced webhook application:
   - Updated `src/spacelift/webhook/app.py`
   - Added `/dummy-workflow` endpoint
   - Implemented workflow triggering mechanism
   - Added logging and error handling for dummy workflow

4. Updated project documentation:
   - Modified `README.md` to include dummy workflow details
   - Added usage instructions
   - Highlighted workflow capabilities

## Technical Details
- Workflow simulates processing stages
- Accepts arbitrary JSON payload
- Returns a dummy result with received payload
- Provides a testable interface for Temporal workflow execution

## Next Steps
- Expand dummy workflow with more complex simulation
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Consider adding configuration options for workflow simulation
- Develop unit tests for the dummy workflow
- Integrate more advanced payload validation
