# Project Overview: Infrastructure Change Handler

## Purpose
The Infrastructure Change Handler is designed to manage and coordinate infrastructure changes across multiple stacks, ensuring proper dependency management and controlled execution of infrastructure updates. It leverages Spacelift.io for infrastructure management while adding sophisticated dependency handling and workflow orchestration.

## Core Components
1. **Infrastructure Change Management**
   - Tracks dependencies between infrastructure stacks
   - Coordinates change propagation across dependent stacks
   - Ensures proper order of infrastructure updates
   - Manages infrastructure state transitions

2. **Stack Dependency Management**
   - Identifies and tracks infrastructure dependencies
   - Label-based dependency resolution
   - Prevents conflicting infrastructure changes
   - Ensures infrastructure consistency

3. **Workflow Orchestration**
   - Temporal workflow integration for reliable execution
   - Manages infrastructure change sequences
   - Handles rollbacks and error scenarios
   - Provides audit trail of infrastructure changes

## Key Features
- Infrastructure dependency tracking
- Change propagation control
- Stack execution orchestration
- Local development environment
- Comprehensive testing support

## Development Philosophy
- Infrastructure as Code principles
- Safe and controlled changes
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive audit trail
- Type safety and validation

## Current Development Status
- Phase 1: Infrastructure Client Integration - Completed
- Phase 2: Webhook Integration - Completed
- Phase 3: Stack Dependency Management - In Progress
- Phase 4: Advanced Change Control Features - Planned
