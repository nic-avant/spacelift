# Project Implementation Phases

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a system to manage Spacelift stack execution using FastAPI and Temporal. The implementation is divided into several phases, each introducing specific features and technologies.

### Phase 1: Set Up FastAPI Webhook ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Create a FastAPI application
- [x] Define an endpoint `/webhook` to receive POST requests
- [x] Process the incoming payload and log the data

**Technology:**
- FastAPI

### Phase 2: Process Notification Payload ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Parse the payload received by the webhook
- [x] Extract relevant information (e.g., stack ID, status) from the payload
- [x] Log the processed data for verification
- [x] Update the webhook endpoint to accept payload data through FastAPI Swagger docs

**Technology:**
- FastAPI

### Phase 3: Set Up Temporal Server ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Run a Temporal server locally using Docker
- [x] Ensure the server is accessible and ready to accept workflow definitions

**Technology:**
- Temporal
- Docker

### Phase 4: Define Temporal Workflow ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Define a Temporal workflow to handle stack execution
- [x] Trigger the workflow with a payload containing stack information
- [x] Implement the workflow logic to manage stack execution
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation for the workflow
- [x] Implement robust error handling and logging

**Technology:**
- Temporal

### Phase 5: Integrate FastAPI with Temporal ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Send the processed payload from the FastAPI webhook to the Temporal workflow
- [x] Trigger the Temporal workflow successfully with the payload
- [x] Test and verify the integration
- [x] Implement unique workflow ID generation
- [x] Add error handling to webhook endpoint

**Technology:**
- FastAPI
- Temporal

### Phase 6: Implement Stack Dependency Management ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Design dependency label format (`dependsOn:stack-id`)
- [x] Implement dependency discovery via Spacelift API
- [x] Create stack dependency chain workflow
- [x] Add child workflows for stack execution
- [x] Implement retry policies and error handling

**Technology:**
- Temporal
- Spacelift API
- GraphQL

### Phase 7: End-to-End Testing ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Test webhook with stack completion events
- [x] Verify dependency discovery logic
- [x] Test workflow chain execution
- [x] Validate stack run triggering
- [x] Document complete workflow

**Technology:**
- FastAPI
- Temporal
- Spacelift
