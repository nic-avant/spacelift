# Project Implementation Phases

## Project Overview

This project involves setting up a system to manage Spacelift stack execution using FastAPI and Temporal. The implementation is divided into several phases, each introducing specific features and technologies.

### Phase 1: Set Up FastAPI Webhook ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Create a FastAPI application
- [x] Define an endpoint `/webhook` to receive POST requests
- [x] Process the incoming payload and log the data

**Technology:**
- FastAPI

### Phase 2: Process Notification Payload ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Parse the payload received by the webhook
- [x] Extract relevant information (e.g., stack ID, status) from the payload
- [x] Log the processed data for verification
- [x] Update the webhook endpoint to accept payload data through FastAPI Swagger docs

**Technology:**
- FastAPI

### Phase 3: Set Up Temporal Server ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Run a Temporal server locally using Docker
- [x] Ensure the server is accessible and ready to accept workflow definitions

**Technology:**
- Temporal
- Docker

### Phase 4: Define Temporal Workflow ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Define a Temporal workflow to handle stack execution
- [x] Trigger the workflow with a payload containing stack information
- [x] Implement the workflow logic to manage stack execution
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation for the workflow
- [x] Implement robust error handling and logging

**Technology:**
- Temporal

### Phase 5: Integrate FastAPI with Temporal ✓
**Features:**
- [x] Send the processed payload from the FastAPI webhook to the Temporal workflow
- [x] Trigger the Temporal workflow successfully with the payload
- [x] Test and verify the integration
- [x] Implement unique workflow ID generation
- [x] Add error handling to webhook endpoint

**Technology:**
- FastAPI
- Temporal

### Phase 6: Configure Spacelift Labels
**Features:**
- [ ] Create labels in Spacelift to trigger the webhook
- [ ] Configure the webhook URL in the Spacelift label settings
- [ ] Test the labels to ensure they trigger the webhook correctly

**Technology:**
- Spacelift

### Phase 7: Test End-to-End Flow
**Features:**
- [ ] Trigger the webhook with a test Spacelift stack change
- [ ] Process the payload and trigger the Temporal workflow
- [ ] Manage the stack execution successfully with the Temporal workflow
- [ ] Verify and document the entire flow

**Technology:**
- FastAPI
- Temporal
- Spacelift

### Phase 8: Security and Compliance Enhancement
**Features:**
- [ ] Implement webhook authentication mechanism
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create secure handling of sensitive configuration data
- [ ] Develop comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Implement compliance tracking for stack executions

**Technology:**
- OAuth/JWT
- Rate limiting libraries
- Input validation frameworks
- Encryption tools
- Audit logging systems

### Phase 9: Performance and Scalability
**Features:**
- [ ] Conduct performance testing of webhook and workflow
- [ ] Implement workflow concurrency management
- [ ] Optimize resource utilization
- [ ] Create monitoring and alerting for system performance
- [ ] Develop metrics collection for workflow executions

- Metrics collection systems

### Future Tasks and Improvements
**Features:**
- [ ] Implement advanced logging and monitoring for workflows
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Create a configuration management system for workflow parameters
- [ ] Develop a notification system for workflow events
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed stack executions
- [ ] Add support for multiple Spacelift stack types and configurations
- [ ] Create a dashboard or reporting mechanism for workflow executions

**Technology:**
- Monitoring tools
- Testing frameworks
- Configuration management
- Notification services
