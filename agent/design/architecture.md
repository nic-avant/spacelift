# System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the system, focusing on key components and their interactions.

## Components

1. **Core System**
   - Main application logic
   - Business rules
   - Data models
   - Service interfaces

2. **External Integrations**
   - Third-party services
   - API connections
   - Data exchange
   - Authentication

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Deployment configuration
   - Scaling strategy
   - Monitoring setup
   - Security measures

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**
   - Independent components
   - Clear interfaces
   - Minimal coupling
   - Maximum cohesion

2. **Scalability**
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Load distribution
   - Resource management
   - Performance optimization

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear structure
   - Documentation
   - Testing strategy
   - Update procedures
