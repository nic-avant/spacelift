## Active Decisions

### Decision 001: Stack Dependency Management via Labels
- **Date**: 2024-01-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Impact**: High

#### Context
Need a flexible way to define dependencies between Spacelift stacks that is:
- Easy to maintain
- Visible in stack configuration
- Queryable via API
- Doesn't require database storage

#### Decision
Use Spacelift stack labels in the format `dependsOn:stack-id` to declare dependencies.

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Simple to implement and understand
- Native to Spacelift's existing label system
- Easy to query via GraphQL API
- Self-documenting in stack configuration
- No additional storage needed

**Negative**:
- Limited to direct dependencies (no complex conditions)
- Manual label management required
- No built-in cycle detection

### Decision 002: Temporal for Workflow Orchestration
- **Date**: 2024-01-14
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Impact**: High

#### Context
Need a reliable system to:
- Handle long-running stack operations
- Manage retries and failures
- Scale with number of dependent stacks
- Provide visibility into execution

#### Decision
Use Temporal for workflow orchestration with:
- Parent workflow for dependency chain management
- Child workflows for individual stack execution
- Activities for API operations
- Built-in retry policies

#### Consequences
**Positive**:
- Reliable execution with automatic retries
- Built-in state management
- Good visibility through Web UI
- Scalable worker architecture

**Negative**:
- Additional infrastructure requirements
- Learning curve for Temporal concepts
- Increased system complexity
